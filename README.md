# biods-final

This Github repository contains all models implemented for our CS271 Final Project: Predicting Cell Type from Spatial Transcriptomic Data. In total, we have notebooks for 6 models:
1) A Baseline MLP model
2) A Periphery Score MLP model 
3) A Cell Boundary CNN
4) A ResNet Cell Boundary Model
5) A Late Fusion Multimodal Model that linearly combines models 2 and 3
6) An early-fusion Transformer model

We used the MERFISH dataset, specially mouse1sample1.hdf5. Periphery scores were calculated and given to us by our external mentors at the Salzman lab.
